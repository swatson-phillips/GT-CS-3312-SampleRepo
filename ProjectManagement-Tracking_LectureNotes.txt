* Common comments:
You need to be updating ticket more regularly but good job on doing some tracking within ZenHub.

You may need to break your tickets down into smaller tasks.

It also appears that not all team members are updating tickets regularly. Please make sure tickets are assigned to and updated by ALL team members.

Good Job! Make sure you continue to have all team members updating tickets in ZenHub.

Make sure you are including estimated story points on your issues.

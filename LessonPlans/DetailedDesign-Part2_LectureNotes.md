# What is Software Architecture? 
## Design vs Architecture?
- Architecture is a plan for the structure of something. Design is a plan to create something.
- An easy way to think about the difference between architecture and design is to consider the architecture of an office building as compared with its interior design.

# Detailed Design System Architecture
## System Architecture Introduction
Introduce this section by providing your reader with enough context to understand the information that follows. 

Include the rationale behind your teamâ€™s architectural choices. You may want to include some information about any security considerations you made. For example, the system needs to authenticate with a 3rd party API or the system will need to use an encryption library to encrypt data. Any security considerations that affect you design should be explained in this section.

Don't worry about spoilers, you can go ahead and tell me what your architecture is and why.

## Static View (section) 
- Major architectural components are shown. 
- **Logical relationships** between components are clear. 
- There are acyclic dependencies. 
- Style(s) are applied when appropriate. 
- Style is correctly applied.

## Dynamic View (section)
- Show runtime behavior of the chosen architecture. 
- Components interact logically and in accordance with style chosen.

## Examples (see Canvas)
- Industry example: https://research.ijcaonline.org/volume37/number3/pxc3876530.pdf (is this a good example?)

**Detailed Design Assignment - Part 2: System Architecture**

# What is Software Architecture? 
    * Design vs Architecture?
        * Architecture is a plan for the structure of something. Design is a plan to create something.
        * An easy way to think about the difference between architecture
        and design is to consider the architecture of an office building as
        compared with its interior design.

# Static View (section) 
   * Major architectural components are shown. **Logical relationships** between
   components are clear. There are acyclic dependencies. Style(s) are applied
   when appropriate. Style is correctly applied.

# Dynamic View (section)
    * Show runtime behavior of the chosen architecture. Components interact
    logically and in accordance with style chosen.

# Examples 
    * Industry example: https://research.ijcaonline.org/volume37/number3/pxc3876530.pdf (is this a good example?)

# Points and Reports
* Make sure that you are estimating points before work begins for your issues to help you plan your next sprint(s). If you are not decomposing an Epic into smaller issues, estimate the points for completing that Epic.

* Make sure all issues start in the same pipeline (i.e Icebox) and move into a shared "started" pipeline (In Progress) so that the Control Chart report displays correctly.

* Consider if you need all of your pipelines. Are they each helping your team track the status of tickets?

# Decomposition and assignment
* Make sure that you are assigning specific issues to team members to be working on in each Sprint.

* Make sure to have all team members updating tickets in ZenHub and assigning issues to themselves as they work on issues.

* Make sure to break down your epics into more specific issues that can be completed by 1 person in 1-3 days.

* Make sure that you are assigning issue to Sprints to be worked.

* Make sure that your pull requests tickets are associated with the correct issue/epic already in your workspace.

# Overall
* Overall good job on doing some tracking within ZenHub make sure to continue updating tickets regularly along with decomposing Epics into smaller issues and assigning points to those issues.

* Overall good job on doing some tracking within ZenHub but you should be updating ticket more regularly along with decomposing Epics into smaller issues and assigning points to those issues.

* Overall your team has done very minimal tracking within ZenHub and you should be updating issues more regularly along with decomposing Epics into smaller issues, assigning point estimates and assigning issues to people to be worked on.

# General
- What kind of application is it? Web application? Mobile application? Command line application? This should be in one of the first paragraphs.
- What kind of architecture are you using and why? How does this help you uphold good design principles? Tell me how your design applies good design principles.
- You've given good rationale for the technologies that you are using but you still should give rationale for your overall architecture and design which is different.
- What kind of architecture are you using and why? How does this help you uphold good design principles?
- Tell me how you are applying good design principles not just that you kept them in mind.
- Make sure that you are upholding conceptual integrity between your static and dynamic diagrams.
- You are lacking conceptual integrity between your static and dynamic designs. I cannot clearly see how the components of your static design are show in the dynamic design.
- You are lacking conceptual integrity between your prose and your diagram in your static system architecture. Make sure that you are using the same terms in your diagram and prose.
- Overall looks good! There are a few in-line comments and notes below to consider. 
- The User/User input is not a part of your system and should not be included as a part of your system; it should only provide input INTO the system.
- Your Dynamic System Architecture is incomplete. You should include some prose that describes the scenario that you are illustrating in your diagram.
- Your Dynamic System Architecture has a lot going on, consider simplifying to the major layer/components in your static design.
- Your Static System Architecture diagram is a bit difficult to read, consider re-organizing the components so that the interaction is more clear.
- You need to make sure you are discussing in prose each of the main components shown in the static architecture diagram.
- You need to make sure you are discussing in prose each of the scenarios shown in the dynamic architecture diagram.
- You should probably include links to the technologies either in-line or in an appendix. 
- Make sure to give some information about about the scenario(s) that you are illustrating. What user story is it and why?
- Make sure that your prose matches what is in the diagram. 
- ** Note that this is not a guarantee of this grade on the final completed Detailed Design Document **
- Nice start! Please see my in-line comments along with below.

# Document formating
- The static and dynamic elements should be under the "System Architecture" section not stand on their own.
- You may consider positioning your figures at either the top or bottom of the page for document design and readability.
- You do not indent paragraphs in technical documents. Instead you separate paragraphs with newlines/space.
- Consider using references to the figure instead of hard coded plain text. Let me know if youâ€™d like help with this.
- Make sure that you are labeling your figures correctly and referencing them from within you prose.
- You may not want to inlcude position information for your diagrams in your prose in case the figures move.
- Make sure that the components you discuss in the prose match the diagram and you may even want to make them in a monospaced font.

# Diagramming
- You may want to indicate what the direction of the arrows in your diagram means. Dependency? Data Flow? (Hint: the static should be dependency and the dynamic should flow/behavior) Does the X component "knows about" the Y component? Or the other way around?
- Make sure that you are using corect syntax for your SSD.
- Your  static arch. diagram is rudimentary and a bit unclear because of the formatting; it should highlight your chosen architecture and technologies. Please see me to discuss if you are unclear.
- Make sure the syntax is correct for your SSD. hint: there is a symbol for an actor on the system.
- Your static and dynamic diagrams feel very different because they are presented differently visually. This is poor document design and erodes conceptual integrity.
- I think the level of detail in your dynamic view is too much and your static is borderline.
-  Make sure that your diagram is at an appropriate level of detail. I think that the self-calls within the system are not necessary. Think about what is essential to illustrate the architectural design NOT the implementation.

# General
- What kind of application is it? Web application? Mobile application? Command line application? This should be in one of the first paragraphs.
- What kind of architecture are you using and why? How does this help you uphold good design principles?
- Tell me how you are applying good design principles not just that you kept them in mind.
- Make sure that you are upholding conceptual integrity between your static and dynamic diagrams.


# Document formating
- The static and dynamic elements should be under the "System Architecture" section not stand on their own.


# Diagramming
- You may want to indicate what the direction of the arrows in your diagram mean. Dependency? Data Flow? (Hint: the static should be dependency and dynamic should be flow/behavior) Does the X omponent "know about" the Y component? Or the other way around?

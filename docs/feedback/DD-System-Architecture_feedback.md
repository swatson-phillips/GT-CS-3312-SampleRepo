# General
- What kind of application is it? Web application? Mobile application? Command line application? This should be in one of the first paragraphs.
- What kind of architecture are you using and why? How does this help you uphold good design principles? Tell me how your design applies good design principles.
- What kind of architecture are you using and why? How does this help you uphold good design principles?
- Tell me how you are applying good design principles not just that you kept them in mind.
- Make sure that you are upholding conceptual integrity between your static and dynamic diagrams.
- You are lacking conceptual integrity between your static and dynamic designs. I cannot clearly see how the components of your static design are show in the dynamic design.
- You are lacking conceptual integrity between your prose and your diagram in your static system architecture. Make sure that you are using the same terms in your diagram and prose.
- Overall looks good! There are a few in-line comments and notes below to consider. 
- The User/User input is not a part of your system and should not be included as a part of your system; it should only provide input INTO the system.
- Your Dynamic System Architecture is incomplete. You should include some prose that describes the scenario that you are illustrating in your diagram.
- Your Dynamic System Architecture has a lot going on, consider simplifying to the major layer/components in your static design.
- Your static system Architecture diagram is a bit difficult to read, consider re-organizing the components so that the interaction is more clear.

- ** Note that this is not a guarantee of this grade on the final completed Detailed Design Document **

# Document formating
- The static and dynamic elements should be under the "System Architecture" section not stand on their own.
- You may consider positioning your figures at either the top or bottom of the page for document design and readability.
- You do not indent paragraphs in technical documents. Instead you separate paragraphs with newlines/space.
- Consider using references to the figure. Let me know if youâ€™d like help with this.


# Diagramming
- You may want to indicate what the direction of the arrows in your diagram mean. Dependency? Data Flow? (Hint: the static should be dependency and dynamic should be flow/behavior) Does the X omponent "know about" the Y component? Or the other way around?
- Make sure that you are using corect syntax for your SSD.

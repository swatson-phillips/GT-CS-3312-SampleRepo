* Make sure to define all acronyms once before using them regardless of if they are defined in the terms. The terms are supplementary, not in the chronology of the document.

* Consider bolding the first letter of each word to make the acronym more clear.

* Does "app" mean web-app, mobile app, something else?

* Terms should be alphabetized.

* Also, make sure that you use all of the terms within your document that you list in your terms.

Technical and domain terminology looks good for this stage of the document development, continue to build out terms and acronyms as needed.

Very light in both technical and domain terms, continue to build out terms and acronyms as needed. This will not result in Mature score.

Some of you definition appear to be incomplete.

A bit light in definitions and some acronyms are not clearly defined (i.e. where the letters come from)

Make sure to alphabetize you entries.

Make sure that your document is uniformly formatted, it looks like it currently is not.

Also consider more clearly delineating the words and the definition especially when the definition flows onto the next line.

Nice job delineating your terms by indenting the lines.

You should be building you completed Detailed Design Document throughout the semester, section by section including this one.

All of your documents should be hosted in your MS Teams/sharepoint and not in Canvas. Make sure you put your detailed design document in Teams and submit a link to it there.

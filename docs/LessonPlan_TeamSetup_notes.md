Notes from 1/12/21

# Pre-class team discussion
What makes you anxious about working in groups? What are some bad group experiences you've had?
What are some things that make group work hard...
- lack of communication (ghosting)
- quality control of work (expectations of work quality)
- delegation of work

# Critique and Confrontations
- Confrontation is not always negative.
- You can learn from each other through discussion.
- Should avoid "group think" so that you can collaborate and make something better than individually
- Don't hide what you don't know
- handling the confrontation is important.

=> take notes on things to include in your team charter
=> take the template prompts out of the team charter template

# Meeting Scenarios discussion
- What kind of meeting/culture do you want to have? Are you okay with things taking longer to talk about?
- By setting the expectations you are better able to give and accept critique of behaviors.
- (student question) Do we need to add all of these scenarios to our charter?
=> Only if they are important to your team.
- Communicate with the person about the issue when it comes up.
- Need to decide how it should be address (when and how).

# Voice Critique (email voice)
What are somethings that the author does poorly if they want the criticism to be received.
- Most people don't mess up on purpose. Try offering a suggestions of how to do/make things better.

- What is a good way to handle these scenarios?
- Keep teammates informed about what is going on in advance.

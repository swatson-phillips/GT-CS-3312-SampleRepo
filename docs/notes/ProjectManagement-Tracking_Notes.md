# Getting started
* Discuss with your client if they are ok with a **public repository**
* New Repo: Profile -> Repositories -> New (pick a meaningful short name and ***include team number***)
* What to track? Whatever works well for your team. Consider tracking **ALL  project tasks** even those that are not software based.
* Check out my page on [Using ZenHub for free for this class](https://github.com/swatson-phillips/GT-CS-3312-WP/blob/master/HowTos/Using%20Github%20and%20ZenHub%20for%20CS%203312.md)
* You can have move than 1 repository IFF it makes sense for your team; don't decompose unnecessarily.

# Zenhub (Task Tracking)
After you have setup your repository(s) for your project, you will need to setup your ZenHub Board (workspace) to track your tasks/issues.
## Resources:
* [GitHub Guides - Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
* [Using ZenHub Issues, Milestones, and Epics (ignore the milestones part)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ375ju3xTc)
* [Estimating (Using ZenHub: planning poker for Teams using GitHub!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_oSM3iKAKc)
* [Using ZenHub: A Closer Look at GitHub Projects and ZenHub](https://youtu.be/dMG_-551xV4)

## Setting up ZenHub
1. Create a ZenHub Workspace - please include your team number for easier access
2. Modify your Board Pipelines to those that will help your team track issue statuses
    * Default: New, IceBox, Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Done, Closed
    * Minimum: New or IceBox, Sprint Backlog, In Progress, Done or Closed
3. Setup sprints
    * set the start date for the first Sprint to be the first day of the semester (a Monday)
    * set the end date for the Sunday 3 weeks later
    * [Getting Started With ZenHub Sprints](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000616465-getting-started-with-zenhub-sprints)
4. Enter **all** user stories as Epics
    * The title should the the story (As a user... I want to...)
    * Assign the epics to Sprints for the first 3 Sprints
    * When you do you iteration plan updates you will assign issues to the next Sprints
    * You should either estimate points for epics or for the issues but not both.
    * It is recommended that you not estimate story points on the Epics (this should done on the issues), unless there are not going to be ANY issues associated with the epic.
5. Decompose your epics for the first Sprint into task issues assigned to the Epic.
    * Make sure to associate the issue with and Epic and a Sprint
    * Estimate the points for the issue
    * Updated the pipeline if this is an issue you will be working on soon.
6. (Optional) Create your releases
    * Only do this is you are planning on using the Release report to link to from your Release Notes
    * You will probably have the following releases this semester: 0.1.0, 0.2.0, 0.3.0, 0.4.0, 1.0.0

# ZenHub Reports
I will look at some of the ZenHub reports for insight into your project and task tracking when I grade for project tracking (mid-term and end of semester). There is lots of information about each of the reports in the ZenHub Help Center. [ZebHub Reports and gathering insights](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/43000042876)
* Cumulative Flow: visualize issue throughput
    * [Reading Cumulative Flow Diagrams](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000038850-reading-cumulative-flow-diagrams)
    * [Example Cumulative Flow Diagrams to learn from](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000469850-example-cumulative-flow-diagrams-to-learn-from)
* Burndown Chart: track velocity during short sprints of work

    * [Plan Long-Term Projects with Release Reports](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000010359-plan-long-term-projects-with-release-reports)
    * You can play with this report but because this is a shorter term project with 1 major release, I won't be requiring it.

# Common Comments
* You need to be updating ticket more regularly but good job on doing some tracking within ZenHub.
* You may need to break your tickets down into smaller tasks.
* It also appears that not all team members are updating tickets regularly. Please make sure tickets are assigned to and updated by ALL team members.
* Good Job! Make sure you continue to have all team members updating tickets in ZenHub.
* Make sure you are including estimated story points on your issues.

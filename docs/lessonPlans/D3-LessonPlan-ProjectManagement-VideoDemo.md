### Iteration Plan (Draft)
* Divide your user stories from part 1 into Sprints keeping in mind that Sprints 1 and 5 will be lighter but still deliver functionality
* Set your Sprint goal. This goes along with the stories that you select. It should be 1 overarching SMART goal (sentence) for what you want to achieve for that Sprint.
* Verify that you have somethings (features) to demo for your client at the end of each Sprint (even Sprints 1 and 5).
* Be realistic about what you can accomplish in a Sprint based on what skills your team has and how many people you have.

### GitHub/ZenHub

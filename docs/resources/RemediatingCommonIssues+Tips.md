# Remediating Common Issues + Tips
## Differing Levels Of Experience
Having a centralized repository of "learning resources" (tutorials and HowTos) can help keep everyone on the same page. You can create a .md file in github to store links or a word document in Teams... whatever works. There are multiple ways of doing a lot of things and making sure everyone goes through the same tutorial can help sync things up ... AND you can create ZenHub tickets to make sure everyone does it (and create a paper trail).

## Accountability and Task Delegation
Having shorter more frequent meetings can really help with both accountability and task delegation. In industry, it is pretty common practice (in an agile environment) to have standup/scrum/round robin daily meetings. These meetings are usually 5 minute (not more than 10) meeting where each person gives their status. I've used the format of each person giving what they did yesterday (*past*), what they are doing today (*present*) and what they will be doing tomorrow (*future*) as a organize the meeting and keep it short. Everyone actually standing up also helps :-) It also helps to have the agile (ZenHub) board pulled up so you can quickly update and create new tickets as needed.

This helps with **accountability** because no one wants to be that person that hasn't done the work they said they were going to do. If team members are consistently on getting their work done, it opens up the opportunity to have a discussion about what is going on:
* Is it workload?
* Is it a roadblock (technical or otherwise)?
* Is it that the issue need to be broken down into more granular tasks?

It helps with **delegation** because if anyone doesn't already have an issue assigned to they to work on next, you can do it right there in the open (and in the ZenHub board) very quickly. You can also create new issues in the board if there is a task that comes up that will be worked on next and go ahead and assign it to a team member.

Your team may not meet daily (even though it's a really go idea), but having *more frequent shorter checkins* is an industry technique that I've seen be really helpful for teams.

At a ***minimum***, you should have an item in your agenda for your weekly meetings to discuss and update ZenHub.

# Tough Problems
What you're doing can be really hard and you are certain to face problems during the course of the project. We give you a number or periods of time for you to work independently (as a team) to get work done and solve problems. During these times when we aren't meeting as a class, you should be meeting as a team either virtually or in person. We encourage you to use this time not necessarily for project planning, but as a **working session** so that you can problem solve. I'm personally not a huge fan of "pair programming" but I have experience the value in having another developer nearby to problem solve with. I've often shared an office with 1 or more other developers and found it really beneficial.

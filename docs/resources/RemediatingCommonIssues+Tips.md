# Remediating Common Issues + Tips
## Differing Levels Of Experience
* Having a centralized repository of "learning resources" (tutorials and HowTos) can help keep everyone on the same page. You can create a .md file in github to store links or a word document in Teams... whatever works. There are multiple ways of doing a lot of things and making sure everyone goes through the same tutorial can help sync things up ... AND you can create ZenHub tickets to make sure everyone does it (and create a paper trail).

* Consider using pull requests and having more experienced team members put in requests and less experienced members review those request in the beginning.

## Accountability and Task Delegation
Having shorter more frequent meetings can really help with both accountability and task delegation. In industry, it is pretty common practice (in an agile environment) to have standup/scrum/round robin daily meetings. These meetings are usually 5 minute (not more than 10) meeting where each person gives their status. I've used the format of each person giving what they did yesterday (*past*), what they are doing today (*present*) and what they will be doing tomorrow (*future*) as a organize the meeting and keep it short. Everyone actually standing up also helps :-) It also helps to have the agile (ZenHub) board pulled up so you can quickly update and create new tickets as needed.

This helps with **accountability** because no one wants to be that person that hasn't done the work they said they were going to do. If team members are consistently on getting their work done, it opens up the opportunity to have a discussion about what is going on:
* Is it workload?
* Is it a roadblock (technical or otherwise)?
* Is it that the issue need to be broken down into more granular tasks?

It helps with **delegation** because if anyone doesn't already have an issue assigned to they to work on next, you can do it right there in the open (and in the ZenHub board) very quickly. You can also create new issues in the board if there is a task that comes up that will be worked on next and go ahead and assign it to a team member.

Your team may not meet daily (even though it's a really go idea), but having *more frequent shorter checkins* is an industry technique that I've seen be really helpful for teams.

At a ***minimum***, you should have an item in your agenda for your weekly meetings to discuss and update ZenHub.

## Tough Technology Problems
What you're doing can be really hard and you are certain to face problems during the course of the project. We give you a number or periods of time for you to work independently (as a team) to get work done and solve problems. During these times when we aren't meeting as a class, you should be meeting as a team either virtually or in person. We encourage you to use this time not necessarily for project planning, but as a **working session** so that you can problem solve. I'm personally not a huge fan of "pair programming" but I have experience the value in having another developer nearby to problem solve with. I've often shared an office with 1 or more other developers and found it really beneficial.

## Indecisive Client
Often we've seen indecisive client in this course. The client that isn't sure of what they want OR wants to change requirements later in the semester. While a part of the agile methodology is to welcome changing requirements (from the client), it is important to be clear and honest about what the tradeoff might be in the MVP if you add or change a feature/requirement. The later in the semester that the change is requested, the more is at stake for the project as a whole; in Sprints 4-5 it could jeopardize the whole project. **At no point should you agree to a "let's see how it goes and decided later."** This leaves the door open for the client to make the request later and leave you in a bad position. Instead make a decision during the meeting and document it!

Any change in requirements need to be documented.
* If it was discussed and decided verbally in a meeting, follow up that meeting with meeting minutes sent by email to the team and client clearly outlining the change.
* If it was an email exchange, then still follow up with and email that clearly details the change: "We are added XYZ story and removing QRS and TUV stories per Mrs. Phillips' request."
* In both cases, make sure to then update your iteration plan which can be included in the above email correspondence.

## Busy client
Oftentimes clients are already busy with other duties which can make it hard to schedule time with them and get information. Here are some strategies that can help:

* Schedule all meetings for the semester at the first meeting. Go into the meeting with suggested dates/time that work or an app setup to take in availability for the dates you'd like to meet. After the dates and times are decided, make sure to send them an Outlook meeting invitation with location information (in-person or virtual).

* Ask if there is someone else that that would be a good contact for the project. Sometimes this can also be helpful if there is a more technical person that can get you any you might need.

* Write really clear emails. Here is a [TikTok on this topic](https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdhcAeBK/) on this.

* Followup all meetings with notes especially if there are action items for your client (i.e. you are waiting on them to get you something)via email. Make sure to include the meeting minutes on what was discussed and promised in the followup email. You can utilize the down-edited meet agenda format that you use for your team meetings if you like.

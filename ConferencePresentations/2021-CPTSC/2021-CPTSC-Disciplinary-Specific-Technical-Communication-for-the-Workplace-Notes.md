 # ... in the time of covid
 ## Changes
 - Much remained unchanged except adding addtional tools
 - Because of the flexibility of the course, we were able to integrate new tools quickly to modify assignments with minimal changes
 - Example: retrospective and virtual whiteboards

## Useful Tools for the Course (some new, some old)
- Remote Whiteboarding: [Padlet](https://padlet.com/), [Pinup](https://pinup.com/), [Stormboard](https://stormboard.com/), [Miro](https://miro.com/online-whiteboard/)
- Versioning: [Github](https://github.com/)
- Tasking: [Zenhub](https://www.zenhub.com/) - integrates with github
- Markdown and README files (this file)
- Prototyping: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- UML (Software) Diagraming: [Argo UML](https://argouml-tigris-org.github.io/), [Visual-Paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/download/community.jsp)
- MS Teams (supported by our instatute) - really nice for this class

### ZenHub
- Integrates with GitHub
- Community edition is free
- [Using ZenHub for academic use- really just if you want an "organization"](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000472530-using-zenhub-for-academic-use)
- nice reporting to see if teams are actually using the tool

# Communicating with Clients
- Students have to learn some basic communication skills like composing a professional email, writing a meeting agenda and taking meeting notes (any WHY)
- Student often have to learn interpersonal communication skill like how to work with a client that is less than ideal (i.e. isn't communicating or changes their mind)
- Video demos and expo

# Challenges of moving to remote instruction
- From an instructor perspective, remote lectures were less personal (dare I say less rewarding) because many students will not turn on their camaras reguardless of out much we pleaded.
- Team dynamic issue were worsened more quickly due to not seeing each other in person.
- Highlighted the need to document communications IN WRITTING instead of just verbally (face-to-face) for accountability and clarity.
- Many sections moved to MS Teams because of the features it provided along with it being a proffessional tool used in "industry"
  - chat client ++
  - channels for meeting and general communication
  - built in file management and versioning (through MS office suit)
  - provided easy mechanism for qick video calls to enhance the remote experience

# Documenting Technical Design
## Traditional Detailed Design Document
 - heavy weight document with lots of detail and requirement
 - multiple views of the system
 - done before coding
 - students (and instructors) HATED it, it felt a lot like a throw-away assignment

[High Level Design and Detailed Design](https://connected-corridors.berkeley.edu/guiding-project-systems-engineering-process/developing-system/icm-system-architecture-and-design)
## Our (new) Detailed Design Document (first piloted Fall 2020)
 - based on the Agile Software development methodology
 - iterative writing of the design document
 - multiple views of the system that are updated as the system is developed
 - opportunity for refinement of the design and the document why learning how to communicate technical designs in writing at an appropriate level of detail
 - What tool to use to host this??? Canvas? MS Teams wiki? Simple Word doc?
 - How do you grade this? iterativly? at the end? hybrid?

# Documenting Technical Design

[High Level Design and Detailed Design](https://connected-corridors.berkeley.edu/guiding-project-systems-engineering-process/developing-system/icm-system-architecture-and-design)
 - Our Detailed design document
  - based on the Agile Software development methodology
  - iterative writing of the design document
  - multiple views of the system that are updated as the system is developed
  - opportunity for refinement of the design and the document why learning how to communicate technical designs in writing at an appropriate level of detail
 # ... in the time of covid
 - much remained unchanged except the tools
 - because of the flexibility of the course, we were able to integrate new tools quickly to modify assignment
 - Example: retrospective and virtual whiteboards

- student often have to learn interpersonal communication skill like how to work with a client that is less than ideal (i.e. isn't communicating or changes their mind)
- video demos and expo

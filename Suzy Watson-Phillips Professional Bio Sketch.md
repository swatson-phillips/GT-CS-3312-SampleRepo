<p>Suzy joined the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/division-computing-instruction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Division of Computing Instruction</a> (DCI) in Spring of 2019 with 10+ years of industry software development experience. She holds a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science (<a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.cs.gsu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia State University</a>) with 2 additional years of graduate coursework at the (<a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Alberta</a>), before opting to return to full time software development in 2011.</p>
<p>In her industry career, Suzy worked her way through the ranks, starting as an entry level maintenance developer and rising to the positions of software development lead and project manager.&nbsp; Her most recent industry job was as a Research Scientist in <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia Tech Research Institute</a>&rsquo;s (GTRI) <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/laboratories/cybersecurity-information-protection-and-hardware-evaluation-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cybersecurity, Information Protection, and Hardware Evaluation Research</a> (CIPHER) division. There, Suzy led a team of 10 developers working on a web-based personnel system, during a critical moment in the software lifecycle when the application was migrated from legacy to newer technologies. Suzy also helped the team implement a modified Agile software development methodology to give the client better insight and complete features more quickly. In October of 2018 Suzy achieved the notable certification status of <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certified Information Systems Security Professional</a> (CISSP) which she still holds today(last renewed 2021-11-01).</p>
<p>In Fall of 2015, Suzy took advantage of a unique teaching partnership between GTRI and the GT academic side, one that brings researchers with real world experience into the GT Classrooms. Her experience with teaching the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://sites.gatech.edu/csjuniordesigncapstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">junior design capstone courses</a> CS 3311 and CS 3312 made her want to be a CS educator. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The part of teaching that inspires Suzy most is participating in that remarkable &ldquo;light-bulb&rdquo; moment - that moment when, building on the educational foundation laid in place and encouraged by previous instructors, the switch flips, and the student begins to understand what it means to be a software developer. She views her role as a computer science educator as that of a facilitator, helping maximize what students put into, and get out, of their education.</p>
<p>By introducing key problems and concepts in computer science, specifically in the area of software design and development, by combining proven educational techniques with her experience in the trenches, Suzy is supporting the next generation of technical problem solvers and innovators in the industry. As a woman in the field of computer science, she strives to encourage and help strengthen women and other minorities in the field, by acting as role model and mentor during the critical first years of major focus, when retention of a diverse community of students is a concern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you've taken the time to read this, consider shooting Suzy an email (suzy.watson-phillips @ cc.gatech.edu) and introducing yourself (after the first week of the semester).</p>

# Getting started with Zenhub
Zenhub is an excellent tool for task tracking and integrates into Github issues. I highly recommend using Zenhub not just for your code development but also other tasks you have to accomplish (like you written documents).

# Using ZenHub for Free

Here are the ways that you can use ZenHub for free for academic use.

1. Use a person account instead of a team "[Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations)" with public or private repos. If you'd like more information about the differences in accounts, here is a nice [article](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts).
2. Use a team "[Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations)" with public repos
3. Use a team "[Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations)" with private repos and request the that it be considered for [academic use](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000472530-using-zenhub-for-academic-use). To do this you will need to contact ZenHub by email at support@zenhub.com with the following:
    1. Your GitHub organization name:

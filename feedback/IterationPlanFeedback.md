# Iteration Plan Comments
## Overall
* Overall nice job! 
* Overall very nice job!
* Overall very nice job! I like your user stories, goals and your scheduling.
* Overall very nice job! There are some in-line annotation comments that you should review but it looks like you've done a good job with developing your user stories, sprint goals and scheduling.

* Please make the minor changes noted in-line and you are good to present to your client.

## Formatting
* Resize columns so there is more room for your user stories; you can shrink the Sprint, Weeks and Goals columns considerably.
 
 ## Scheduling
* Your plan is a bit optimistic for a 5 person team but you can adjust as need for the scheduled iteration plan updates (see living schedule). Make sure to convey to your client that this is an optimistic plan and there may be some schedule slip. You may also want to have the conversation about story priority and make sure those less important stories are prioritize appropriately.

* Your Sprints end on Sunday, You should probably make the dates of delivery the Monday after.

## Stories
* I'm am a bit concerned with your iteration plan and the features listed and their granularity and the prospective. 
* Consider writing your features as user stories. 
* I don't believe the granularity of some of your features is fine enough for adequately documenting what will be accomplished in each of the Sprints. Consider breaking the features into smaller features and/or include alternate paths/scenarios. 
* Also make sure you are being specific/clear and not vague in your language (i.e. what does expand actually include).

* Other than Sprint 5 being too light, (see note below), you work distribution looks good and your user stories are on the right track. Your Sprint goals seem to align well with your stories.

* Is this a feature of the application or a task for you to accomplish? This iteration plan should outline the user stories or application features and NOT development tasks; the audience is your client not your team.

* Your Sprint 5 user story is not an actual feature. Just because you write something in the user story format, doesn't make it a valid feature user story ;-) Consider moving a feature from the previous Sprint down. It is perfectly fine to complete features early.

* You need to be developing features (user stories) in every Sprint including 4 and 5. I specifically said not to have a testing/bug fixes Sprint(s) in lecture.

* You are missing the "so that I" business benefit from some of your stories, make sure to include that to be clear about why you will be working on the story.
* Make sure to include the "so that I" part of the user story to illustrate the benefit to the client/business.

* It doesn't appear that your Sprint goals align with the user stories that you are working on. Make sure that the Sprint goal is closely related to the stories selected for that Sprint.

* You cannot prove this, not a testable feature, also not something that you can demo. (so it shouldn't be included here)

* This seems like a big feature to complete. You may want to break it down into smaller features.

* This is not testable nor demo-able, make sure each user story is both

* Looks like you have a good start at some tasking and scheduling but your features/ user stories need work. I'm am a bit concerned with your iteration plan and the features listed and their granularity and the prospective. Consider writing your features as user stories. Your features read more like a task list and not like features of the MVP. Also make sure you are being specific/clear and not vague in your language (i.e. what does recent actually mean?).

* Each feature/story should be testable and demo-able.

## Goals
* Consider making your goals more concise. "Basic user account creation"...
* The goal should be related to the user stories, please change to reflect the focus of the stories listed here.

## Other
* I would be happy to meet with the team to discuss and you may re-submit with corrections by 2/2.

* See comments on the document.
* A few in-line annotations on the document, please review them.
* See in-line annotated comments also.
